## Div (at least 2):

I used divs to group my recipe content together for balance and I also used a div to group the audio player and its associated content together, ensuring proper alignment and structure.

## Span (at least 2):

I used a span to highlight specific words in the recipe descriptions.
I used another span in the other recipe descriptions

## Audio (at least 1):

I used an audio element to embed an audio file that users can listen to while cooking, with controls to play, pause, and loop the audio.

## Video (at least 1):

I originally planned to use a video element to display recipe videos, allowing users to watch video instructions directly on the page. Instead, I used a hero video.

## Iframe (at least 1):

I used an iframe to embed an external cooking timer from another website, allowing users to set a timer directly within the webpage.

## Class (at least 2):

I used the class nav to style the navigation links, ensuring consistent formatting across the navigation bar.
I used the class media-item to structure the layout of the audio and timer sections, applying the same styles for spacing and alignment.

## Escape Character (at least 1):

I used the &copy; escape character to display the copyright symbol (Â©) in the footer of the webpage, providing a legal symbol without using a special character.
