I'm continuing to work on my travel blog for the rest of the semester. For this weeks assignment I incorporated all of the required elements to the website. It includes four pages and a css layout. In my coding I included an html5 canvas and javascript functionality, although I did struggle with those two techniques. My navigation tabs as well as my photos highlight and become a little bit larger when the cursor is placed over them.
