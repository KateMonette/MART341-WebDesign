## Assignment 11

For my assignment 11 I used many different elements. This weeks assignment took the longest to do so far, But I am happy with the outcome. 

### Techniques
I imported a font to use on my website and adjusted the background and text color. I also incorporated navigation links so that users can go from page to page easily. The images have a hover effect so that there is a zoom in when hovering over an image. I also incorporated a header and a footer with my picture so that users can see who is behind the screen. My website includes a gallery and quote section as well. I also used many differnt font weights and sizes. This was the most challenging assignment so far, but I think it turned out well!
