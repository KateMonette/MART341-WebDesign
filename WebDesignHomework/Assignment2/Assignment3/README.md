# Problems
## Problem Solving
As I was creating my folder in the Visual Studio Code, I was about to add the folder to my Github repository, but the folder disappeared. I looked for it everywhere and it finally appeared randomly so I'm not sure if it was anything I did to solve the problem, but it fixed itself. After, I saw that I had accidentally skips many of the steps for creating the markdown README.md file in the Visual Studio Code. The steps for each assignment are very helpful and easy to follow along with.
