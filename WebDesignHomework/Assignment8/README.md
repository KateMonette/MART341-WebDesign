## Div (at least 2):

I used divs to group my recipe content together for balance and I also used a div to group the audio player and its associated content together, ensuring proper alignment and structure.

## Span (at least 2):

I used a span to highlight specific words in the recipe descriptions.
I used another span in the other recipe descriptions

## Audio (at least 1):

I used an audio element to add a section where users can listen to music while they cook. 

## Video (at least 1):

I used a hero video at the top of the Recipes section.  

## Iframe (at least 1):

I used an iframe to embed an external cooking timer from another website.

## Class (at least 2):

I used the class nav so that the navigation links all have the same style. 
I also used class so that the audio and timer sectionshave the same style as well. 

## Escape Character (at least 1):

I used the &copy; escape character to display the copyright symbol (Â©) in the footer of the webpage.
