# Reflection #

The website idea I chose to expand on was the cooking blog. I chose this idea because I love to cook and I want to be able to document my recipes. The tone of the website will be light and playful. 

I think the background color adds character to the website and it creates a more inviting space. 

My final design turned out as I expected and I think the colors and layout pull the website together. 

When my coding didn't work, I would go back and look it over only to realize that I had extra spaces or minor mistakes that I looked over. I solved them by going through each line and fixeding them.
