<h1>Website Ideas</h1>

<h3>Cooking Blog</h3>

<p>My first website idea, and the one I'm most excited about, is a cooking blog. In this website I would hope to gain a large audience so that I am able to write a cook book and sell many copies. The tone of the website will be relaxed and playful.</p>

<h3>Travel Blog</h3>

<p>My second website idea would be a travel blog. I love to travel and fortunately have been many places. The purpose of this website would be to recommend places for people to visit. The website would include pictures as well as summaries of each location.</p>

<h3>Business Website</h3>  

<p>I'm hoping to open up a coffee shop one day and in order to gather more customers, I would need to make a website for the shop. </br> The website would include the menu items and nutritional facts of the drinks and food. The tone would be playful and the website would have a calming aesthetic.</p>
